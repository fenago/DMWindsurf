# React Base App

A foundational React application with authentication, user roles, and payment processing functionality. This app provides a complete starting point for building scalable web applications with user management.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Full authentication flow with sign up, login, and logout using Firebase
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Three user roles (FREE, SUBSCRIBER, ADMIN) with different permissions and UI
- **Stripe Payment Integration**: Payment processing for subscription plans with Stripe
- **Responsive Design**: Modern, mobile-friendly UI built with custom CSS
- **Protected Routes**: Route guarding based on authentication status

## User Roles

- **FREE**: Default role for all new users. Access to basic features only.
- **SUBSCRIBER**: Paid users who gain access to premium features after successful payment.
- **ADMIN**: Administrative users with access to all features plus admin-only functionality.

## Environment Setup

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your API keys and configuration values:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
